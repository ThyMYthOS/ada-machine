#!/bin/sh
#  tests/run_tests.sh -- boot every test application under QEMU and ASSERT its
#  verdict.   Driven by `make test` (run from rts-spikes/); see the comment above
#  the `test` target in the Makefile, and RTS-PRODUCTION.md A4.
#
#  usage: sh tests/run_tests.sh [test-name ...]       (default: every test listed)
#
#    QEMU QEMU_MACHINE QEMU_MIN   as for smoke.sh (qemu_preflight.sh)
#    TEST_LIST      the list of tests (default tests/tests.list)
#    TEST_TIMEOUT   seconds a test may run before it is killed (default 30)
#
#  THE PROTOCOL (tests/common/test_report.ads): a test prints
#      TEST <name>: START ... "  FAIL: <what>" lines ... TEST <name>: PASS|FAIL
#  on a guest serial port (column 3 of the list says which: 0 = MMUART0, 1 = MMUART1;
#  both are always attached, each to its own file). A `pass` test passes only if ALL hold:
#      - its image exists                              (else FAIL, never a skip)
#      - "TEST <name>: START" was printed              (the program really ran)
#      - "TEST <name>: PASS" was printed               (it reached its verdict)
#      - no "TEST <name>: FAIL" line, and no "  FAIL:" line
#      - every line of <dir>/console.expected, if the file exists, appears on the
#        port (output is asserted by the HOST: a program cannot check its own wire)
#  and fails with the reason otherwise: a failed check, a missing sentinel (hang,
#  crash, silence), a missing line, or a timeout. If <dir>/console.in exists its
#  bytes are fed to the serial port as the guest's input.
#
#  EXPECTED FAILURES. A row whose `expect` is `xfail` documents a KNOWN runtime
#  defect. It is not a skip and not a pass; it must fail IN THE DOCUMENTED WAY:
#      - the test must NOT print "TEST <name>: PASS" on its port (if it does, that
#        is an UNEXPECTED PASS: the defect is fixed -- flip the row to `pass`), and
#      - the row's `observe` regexp (grep -E) must match somewhere in QEMU's
#        `-d int,guest_errors` trace or on either serial port. A test that fails
#        for a DIFFERENT reason (including one that now gets as far as START and
#        then dies elsewhere) is a failure, never an xfail: that is the whole
#        point of requiring a signature. Re-document the row, or fix the defect.
#  The trace signature depends on QEMU's log format; it fails closed (a format
#  change turns an xfail into a failure that says so), never open.
#
#  Exit status: non-zero if ANY test failed. A test list that is empty or
#  malformed is a failure too (zero tests must not mean zero failures).
#
#  The console is searched on the guest's serial ports only (-serial file:...),
#  never on QEMU's own stderr -- the same rule as smoke.sh -- and each test ends
#  as soon as its outcome is decided, so a passing run is fast and the timeout
#  only costs anything when something is wrong. The bound is a watchdog
#  (background + poll + kill -9), not `timeout`/alarm(): QEMU swallows SIGALRM
#  and BSD userland has no `timeout` (Makefile, above the `qemu` target).
#
#  POSIX sh only: this runs under dash (Ubuntu's /bin/sh) and macOS's bash-as-sh.
